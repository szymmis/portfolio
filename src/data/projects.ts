      "My biggest pride, an open-source library that let's you easily integrate your express server with Vite frontend. With almost 200k downloads on NPM and 400+ GitHub stars, it simplifies setups for demos, proofs of concept, and learning projects. It helped me understand internals of express and how middleware work, as well as how Vite serves files and how HMR works.",

      "I was doing a little demo app that was supposed to take a file input from the user, process it, then send back. As I needed a library for parsing form data I stumbled upon multer but it was too big for my app, and there was a lack of something small. I like learning by creating, so I've decided to make a middleware that will be able to parse that form data. That's how this project was born and I've learned so much cool ideas in the process.",

      "This project holds a special place for me ‚Äî it's written in Rust, which is a big deal these days. Beyond the trend, working on it taught me essential low-level concepts. I delved into understanding memory allocations, the distinctions between stack and heap, the true nature of pointers, and what it even means to allocate on the heap. These are aspects often taken for granted in high-level languages. This journey has been a fascinating adventure!",

There's something about grasping Rust concepts that empowers you to tackle projects you wouldn't have considered before. That's how I found myself building a language parser‚Äîenvisioned as a Bash replacement, it's more of a concept with potential. Not having enough time to work on, prevents me from pushing it further, but sometimes it's not about completing the project; it's about embracing the learning journey.",

For me, it was the pain of configuring ZSH with scripts and plugins and the Node environment. After multiple system reinstalls in a week I've decided to create a script to automate it. I have then seen how bad it is to work with Bash or shell scripting. That's how I've came up with Sane Shell idea.",

That way I was able to answer my question and also learn how to create an extension for my favourite editor, and what the posibilities are.

If you're familiar with the game, you know the grind to max out friendship levels with villagers is real. Constantly checking wikis for their preferences felt tedious, so I've created a modification that shows you the info about what people like. This project is an interesting one, because I've had to do a lot of reverse engineering to get stuff done. That's the best way to learn how to read and understand the code.",

I've gotten pretty good grade on this one, so maybe it isn't that bad after all?",
